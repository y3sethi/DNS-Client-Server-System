DNS Client-Server System

A simplified authoritative DNS server-client system implemented in Python using UDP sockets. This project follows DNS protocol specifications as outlined in relevant RFCs, providing a deeper understanding of DNS resolution, network communication, and protocol parsing.

## Features

- Custom authoritative DNS server handling domain lookups over UDP
- Python-based client that sends DNS queries and parses responses
- Fully RFC-compliant query and response structure
- Robust error handling for malformed requests and invalid domains
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) for interactive domain resolution

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- UDP sockets (`socket` module)
- RFC 1035-style DNS packet formatting and parsing

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with network protocols and socket programming
- Understood the structure of DNS packets and domain resolution logic
- Practiced implementing protocol-level communication over UDP
- Applied robust error handling and validation techniques
